Inspiration
===========

When I was a kid, I learned BASIC thanks to the Byte Brothers books.  The adventures of two young men determined to solve mysteries using only their wits and their micro-computer.

You can buy copies of the books from Amazon http://bit.ly/ByteBros and many other retailers.

I am indebted Lois McCoy (Cowan) the author and copyright holder of the Byte Brothers books for giving her kind permission to adapt some of her wonderful stories.
